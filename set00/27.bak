;; combine-listStrings-addSpaces : ListOfString -> String
;; GIVEN: List of strings for concatenation
;; RESULT: Concatenated list of given string; space added between each String in List
;; Examples:
;;  (combine-listStrings-addSpaces (list "Mary" "little" "lamb")) = "Mary little lamb"
;;  (combine-listStrings-addSpaces (list "Jack" "jumped" "candlestick"))= "Jack jumped candlestick"
;;  (combine-listStrings-addSpaces (list "Wolf" "blew" "house" "down")) = "Wolf blew house down"
;; DESIGN STRATEGY: Function Composition
